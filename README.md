**✨ Welcome to My GitHub! ✨**  

Hi, I’m a passionate **newbie** on an exciting journey to master the art of coding and creativity! 🌟  

While I’m just starting out with **HTML** and **C**, my hunger to learn and grow knows no bounds. I believe every expert was once a beginner, and here’s what I aim to achieve as I level up:  
- **💻 Code Ninja:** Master programming languages and become a pro at solving real-world problems.  
- **🌐 Web Wizard:** Craft stunning, functional websites that stand out.  
- **📱 App Innovator:** Build cutting-edge applications that make a difference.  
- **🤖 AI Dreamer:** Explore the magic of AI and create systems like GPTs that redefine possibilities.  
- **🎬 Video Creator:** Add a creative spark to my storytelling with pro video editing skills.  

This space is my playground to experiment, grow, and collaborate. I’m here to share my progress, learn from the community, and turn my dreams into reality. 🚀  

Let’s connect, create, and inspire together! 🔥
